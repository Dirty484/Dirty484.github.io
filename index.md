### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    My favorite part of Lab 7 was that for the first time while doing a lab, I encountered a problem I couldn't fix myself. Asking for help in figuring out how to write code for something complex, such as calculating multiple times a car can be on for each street. It also helped that I had an Amazing Lab partner who associated with me in doing this assignment

* Lab 6
    
    The thing I loved about Lab 6 was the fact that we were making something that I could see using out of class. We wrote code that would help calculate and simulate a game of BlackJack. Though it was some trouble to get to that point.

* Lab 10

    The reason why I chose Lab 10 part-1 is because to me this was the lab in which I excelled at. During this lab, I felt that I excelled in working together with my partner and improved in writing code. In this assignment, my partner and I had to write code to organize the population of California counties.
