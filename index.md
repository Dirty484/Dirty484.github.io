### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    My favorite part of Lab 7 was that for the first time while doing a lab, I encountered a problem I couldn't fix myself. Asking for help in figuring out how to write code for something complex, such as calculating multiple times for each street. It also helped that I had an Amazing Lab partner who associated with me in doing this assignment
